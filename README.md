# ADAM
This was made for the Apple Overnight Visuals Team (iKnghts) as a funny way to 
let someone know that a software restore computer should not be accessed 
- Think "Jurassic Park"

This was never used. "adam.qtz" would have been placed in the "/Library/Screen\ Savers/" 
directory and launched whenever a computer had to be left unattended   I also had started 
work on a standalone application with a unlock code located in the debug folder with the 
name "adam.app" It's unfinished.
